# dotfiles

This repository contains (most of) the dotfiles that I use on my system(s).

* `~/.vimrc`
* `~/.zshrc`
* `~/.config/i3/config`
* `link.sh` (to automatically link stuff from the repository to the right places on new machines)
* `vim.sh`(to download `pathogen.vim`)

It does not contain:

* My configuration for `weechat` (since that one contains passwords, even though they aren't plaintext)
* My configuration for `meli` (since that one contains passwords, .. in plaintext, ugh!)
